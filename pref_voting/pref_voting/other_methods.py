        Devised by Wesley H. Holliday as a simple Condorcet-compliant method for political elections. Always elects a Condorcet winner if one exists and elects only the Condorcet winner provided the Condorcet winner receives at least one first-place vote. Edward B. Foley suggested the name 'Superior Voting' because the method is based on the idea that if A is superior to B, then A should get B's first-place votes added to their own.
